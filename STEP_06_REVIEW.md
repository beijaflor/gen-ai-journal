# Step 6: Review and Refine Summaries

This step focuses on reviewing and refining the summaries of articles selected for both journals.

## Objective

Ensure all selected summaries are:
- Accurate and well-written
- Consistent in tone and style
- Properly formatted
- Ready for inclusion in final journals

## Input Files

- **Main Journal Sources:** `workdesk/curated_journal_sources.md`
- **Annex Journal Sources:** `workdesk/curated_annex_journal_sources.md`
- **Main Journal Summaries:** `workdesk/unified_summaries_main.md`
- **Annex Journal Summaries:** `workdesk/unified_summaries_annex.md`
- **Individual Summaries:** `workdesk/summaries/*.md` (for reference if needed)

## Review Process

### 1. Review Main Journal Summaries

- [ ] Review all summaries in `workdesk/unified_summaries_main.md`
- [ ] These are pre-filtered to include only main journal content

### 2. Review Annex Journal Summaries

- [ ] Review all summaries in `workdesk/unified_summaries_annex.md`
- [ ] These are pre-filtered to include only annex journal content

### 3. Review Criteria

Check each summary for:
- **Accuracy:** Does the summary accurately represent the article?
- **Clarity:** Is the Japanese clear and well-structured?
- **Tone:** Does it match the editorial voice (see `EDITOR_PERSONALITY.md`)?
- **Length:** Is it appropriately concise yet informative?
- **Format:** Are links, titles, and sections properly formatted?

### 4. Edit and Refine

Make improvements to:
- [ ] Fix any grammatical or stylistic issues
- [ ] Ensure consistent formatting across all summaries
- [ ] Add or clarify key points if needed
- [ ] Remove redundant information
- [ ] Verify all links work correctly

### 5. Organize for Assembly

Consider creating working files:
- [ ] `workdesk/reviewed_main_summaries.md` (optional)
- [ ] `workdesk/reviewed_annex_summaries.md` (optional)

Or work directly with the unified summary file, marking which summaries are for which journal.
