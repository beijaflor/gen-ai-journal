## Objective

Ensure all selected summaries are:
- Accurate and well-written
- Consistent in tone and style
- Properly formatted
- Ready for inclusion in final journals

## Input Files

- **Main Journal Sources:** `journals/YYYY-MM-DD/sources/curated_journal_sources.md`
- **Annex Journal Sources:** `journals/YYYY-MM-DD/sources/curated_annex_journal_sources.md`
- **All Summaries:** `journals/YYYY-MM-DD/summaries/*.md`
- **Unified Summary:** `journals/YYYY-MM-DD/unified_summaries.md`

## Review Process

### 1. Filter Selected Summaries

### 2. Review Each Selected Summary

Or work directly with the unified summary file, marking which summaries are for which journal.
