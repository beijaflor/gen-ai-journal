# Step 11: Create Pull Request

## Overview
Create a pull request for the completed journal. In the modern workflow, pull requests are typically created early in the process (after Step 3 or when significant work begins) to enable collaborative editing and continuous review.

## When to Create PR
**Early Creation (Recommended):**
- Create PR after Step 3 (Prepare Journal) when structure is ready
- Allows for collaborative editing throughout the workflow
- Enables continuous review and feedback

**Late Creation (Legacy):**
- Create PR after Step 10 (Archive & Cleanup) when journal is complete
- Traditional approach for final review only

## Pre-PR Checklist

- [ ] Workdesk is cleaned up (sources and summaries archived)
- [ ] URLs verified and working

## What Happens Next

### For Early PR Creation:
1. **Continuous Development**: Continue with Steps 4-10, committing progress regularly
2. **Collaborative Editing**: Team members can review and contribute throughout development
3. **Draft Status**: PR remains in draft until journal is complete
4. **Final Review**: Convert to ready-for-review when Step 10 is complete

### For Complete Journal:
1. **Human Review**: The human reviewer will examine the journal content and quality
2. **Merge Decision**: Human will merge the PR when ready to publish
3. **Publication**: After merge, proceed to [STEP_12_TAG_PUBLISH.md](STEP_12_TAG_PUBLISH.md) for tagging and publication

## Workflow Integration

**Modern Recommended Flow:**
```
Step 00 â†’ Step 01 â†’ Step 02 â†’ Step 03 â†’ CREATE DRAFT PR â†’ Steps 04-10 â†’ CONVERT TO READY â†’ Human Review â†’ Merge â†’ Step 12
```

**Legacy Flow:**
```
Steps 00-10 â†’ CREATE PR â†’ Human Review â†’ Merge â†’ Step 12
```

## Notes
- **Early PR Creation** enables better collaboration and continuous feedback
- **Draft PRs** keep development visible without requesting immediate review
- **Human retains control** over publication timing regardless of PR creation method
- **Branch cleanup** happens in STEP_12 after successful publication
- **Continuous commits** during development help track progress and enable rollback if needed
