---

## Cross-Cutting Issues Identified

### 1. Editorial Plan Article ID Mismatches

**Theme 4 (エージェント向けプロトコル)**
- **Plan listed**: #070, #071, #080
- **Editorial notes referenced**: UCP (#032, #033) and MCP Sampling (#034)
- **Resolution**: Used #032, #034 based on editorial notes, not candidate IDs
- **Root cause**: Possible numbering error when plan was created

**Theme 5 (Tailwind解雇75%)**
- **Plan listed**: #016, #018, #122, #138
- **Missing**: Actual Tailwind article (#044)
- **Resolution**: Added #044, removed off-theme #122 and #138
- **Root cause**: Theme title didn't match candidate articles

### 2. Articles Appearing in Multiple Themes

**#019 (Copilot Studio)**: Themes 2 and 7
- **Resolution**: Rejected from both themes (too tutorial-focused)

**#020 (Smartphone Coding)**: Themes 1 and 7
- **Resolution**: Rejected from both themes (tangential to both)

**Implication**: These articles lack sharp thematic focus, suggesting they're better suited for Annex journal.

### 3. Score vs. Selection Discrepancy

**Low-scoring but SELECTED**:
- #006 (58/100): Essential for OpenAI decline narrative
- #010 (69/100): Unique philosophical perspective on AI deception
- #011 (60/100): Important AI rejection manifesto

**High-scoring but REJECTED**:
- #019 (100/100): Tutorial-level content despite perfect score
- #210 (86/100): Off-topic for coding journal (AI character animation)

**Lesson**: Scores are helpful but not deterministic. Editorial judgment considers thematic fit, narrative arc, and unique insights beyond numerical ratings.

## Curation Principles Applied

### 1. Thematic Coherence Over Individual Quality
- Rejected high-scoring off-theme articles (#210: 86/100)
- Selected lower-scoring theme-essential articles (#006: 58/100)
- **Rationale**: Main journal tells a story; each article must advance that narrative

### 2. Avoid Duplication Within and Across Themes
- Rejected #033 (UCP duplicate) despite 88/100 score
- Rejected #072, #073 (belong in Theme 2, already covered by #145)
- **Rationale**: Reader value maximized by diverse perspectives, not redundant coverage

### 3. Prioritize Primary Sources and Deep Analysis
- Selected Redis author (#003), Drupal founder (#044), Gary Marcus (#006)
- Rejected podcast discussions and tutorials
- **Rationale**: Authoritative voices and original analysis > aggregated opinions

### 4. Balance Optimism and Skepticism
- Optimism: #003 (end of coding), #091 (AI-native teams)
- Skepticism: #006 (OpenAI decline), #011 (AI rejection), #027 (security)
- **Rationale**: Comprehensive view requires both perspectives

### 5. Technical Depth Over Accessibility
- Selected architectural patterns (#004), security research (#153), protocol specs (#032, #034)
- Rejected surface-level tutorials and tool reviews
- **Rationale**: Target audience is web app engineers seeking deep insights

### 6. Lasting Value Over Timeliness
- Selected design patterns (#004), business model analysis (#044), UX research (#168)
- Rejected ephemeral tool updates and news announcements
- **Rationale**: Journal should remain valuable weeks/months after publication

---

## Recommendations for Future Curation

### 1. Editorial Plan Improvements
- **Verify article IDs** before finalizing theme assignments
- **Check candidate articles** match theme titles (e.g., Tailwind theme had no Tailwind articles)
- **Avoid duplicate listings** (articles appearing in multiple themes)

### 2. Scoring Methodology Refinement
- **Lower scores for tutorials** even if well-written (current: #019 = 100/100)
- **Weight thematic fit** more heavily in Main Journal score
- **Separate score** for "Annex suitability" (some high-quality articles don't fit main journal)

### 3. Candidate Pool Expansion
- **Include more security/ethics** articles (Theme 3 was lean)
- **Seek architectural perspectives** (Theme 1 had only one strong architecture article)
- **Find more organizational** content (Theme 2 had only one team-building article)

### 4. Documentation Process
- **Record rejected articles** with reasons (done in this report)
- **Track theme-hopping articles** (#019, #020) for Annex assignment
- **Note ID mismatches** during planning phase to avoid curation confusion

## Conclusion

This curation successfully identified 20 high-quality articles that:
1. **Tell a coherent story** across 7 themes
2. **Balance optimism and skepticism** about AI in coding
3. **Provide technical depth** for professional web app engineers
4. **Include authoritative voices** (Redis, Drupal, Gary Marcus, etc.)
5. **Avoid duplication** and surface-level content
6. **Offer lasting value** beyond this week's news cycle

The main challenges were:
- Editorial plan ID mismatches requiring detective work
- Missing key articles (Tailwind #044) from candidate list
- Articles appearing in multiple themes (#019, #020)
- Balancing scores with thematic fit (#006: 58/100 but essential)

Despite these challenges, the final selection achieves the goal of 18-25 essential articles with strong thematic coherence and editorial quality.

**Next Step**: Proceed to STEP_05 (Generate Non-Main Sources) after this curation is approved.
