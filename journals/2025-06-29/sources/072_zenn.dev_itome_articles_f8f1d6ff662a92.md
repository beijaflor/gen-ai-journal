This article explores application development strategies in the era of "Claude Code." The author posits that while AI tools lik[4]e Claude Code accelerate development, they also demand a more rapid iteration cycle of specification, implementation, code review, and operational checks. The piece highlights the challenges of us[4]ing AI in mobile app development, such as environmental dependencies, lengthy build times, and difficulties with immediate execution and deployment. As a solution, the author recommends usin[4]g Expo (React Native), pointing to its Over-The-Air (OTA) update feature for instant previews and releases.
