This article introduces and reviews "OpenHands CLI," a new open-source, MIT-licensed command-line interface tool similar to Claude Code. The author walks through the installation process and demonstrates its [5]capabilities by generating "hello world" programs in multiple languages. The article notes that OpenHands CLI can understand and respond in Japa[5]nese and can handle tasks like installing necessary dependencies when errors occur. While the author sees promise in the tool, they also mention that it is[5] still in early development, with some warnings and slower response times compared to Claude Code.
