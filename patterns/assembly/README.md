# Assembly Pattern Library

## Overview

This directory contains **assembly patterns** for organizing journal themes. Patterns are NOT rigid templates—they're conversational guides that help decide **how** to structure articles within a theme.

## Purpose

Assembly patterns solve the gap between:
- **STEP_03b**: Which articles belong to which themes
- **STEP_08**: How to actually assemble those articles into coherent narratives

By codifying successful patterns from past journals, we can:
1. Make assembly decisions faster and more consistent
2. Build institutional knowledge over time
3. Maintain flexibility while providing structure
4. Create reusable strategies that improve with each journal

## How Patterns Work

### Pattern Selection (STEP_07)

For each theme:
1. **AI reviews** available patterns and proposes best match
2. **AI explains** why pattern fits (or doesn't)
3. **Human approves** or requests different pattern
4. **Conversational customization**: Adjust pattern to theme needs
5. **Document strategy** in editorial plan

### Pattern Application (STEP_08)

Each pattern provides:
- **When to use**: What types of themes fit this pattern
- **Structure**: How to order articles
- **Assembly guidelines**: What to emphasize
- **Narrative flow**: How to write transitions and conclusions
- **Examples**: References to past journals using this pattern

## Available Patterns

1. **[single-focus.md](./single-focus.md)**: One major topic with multiple reactions
2. **[multi-perspective.md](./multi-perspective.md)**: Multiple equal viewpoints on same topic
3. **[progressive-sequence.md](./progressive-sequence.md)**: Articles that build on each other
4. **[debate-contrast.md](./debate-contrast.md)**: Opposing viewpoints creating tension

## Creating New Patterns

When existing patterns don't fit:

1. **During STEP_07**: Recognize the unique structure needed
2. **Define the pattern**: What makes this theme different?
3. **Document in new file**: Follow existing pattern template
4. **Use for current journal**: Apply immediately
5. **Available for future**: Pattern joins library for reuse

### New Pattern Template

```markdown
# [Pattern Name]

## When to Use
[Describe what types of themes fit this pattern]

## Structure
[How to order articles]

## Assembly Guidelines
[What to emphasize, how to group]

## Narrative Flow
[Intro/transition/conclusion strategies]

## Example from Past Journals
[Reference specific uses]
```

## Pattern Evolution

After each journal:
- Review what worked/didn't work
- Update patterns with new insights
- Add references to successful examples
- Extract new patterns if emergent structures appear

## Guidelines vs Templates

**Patterns are guidelines, not templates:**
- ✅ Provide strategic direction
- ✅ Suggest proven structures
- ✅ Offer narrative strategies
- ❌ NOT rigid markdown templates
- ❌ NOT prescriptive formulas
- ❌ NOT required if better approach exists

**Customization is expected:**
- Hybrid patterns (combining elements)
- Pattern variations (modified for context)
- Custom one-off patterns (documented for future)

## Using Patterns in Workflow

### STEP_03b: Editorial Planning
- Identify themes
- Map articles to themes
- Draft theme introductions
- *Patterns NOT selected yet*

### STEP_07: Assembly Planning (NEW)
- **Read pattern library**
- **For each theme**: AI proposes pattern + rationale
- **Conversational refinement**: Customize to fit theme
- **Document assembly strategy** in editorial plan
- Output: Enhanced editorial plan with detailed assembly notes

### STEP_08: Theme Assembly
- **Read STEP_07 assembly strategies**
- **Follow selected patterns** for each theme
- **Apply customizations** documented in plan
- **Assemble with narrative flow** following pattern guidelines

## Benefits

1. **Progressive Learning**: Library grows with each journal
2. **Consistency**: Proven patterns reduce ad-hoc decisions
3. **Flexibility**: Patterns adapt to unique themes
4. **Speed**: Clear assembly direction speeds up STEP_08
5. **Quality**: Codified best practices improve narrative flow
6. **Knowledge Transfer**: Explicit patterns are teachable
