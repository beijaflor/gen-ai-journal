# **Goal**

Summarize the article according to instructions below. Output the summary as structured JSON matching the v1.0 schema.

Article contents is very last of prompt.

**IMPORTANT**: Your output will be validated against a JSON schema. The schema is enforced programmatically via `response_schema` parameter, so you must follow the exact field names and types specified.

# **Content Validation**

Before summarizing, check if article content was successfully fetched:
- If content is empty, missing, or fetch failed → Return JSON with error indicator:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "version": "1.0",
    "generatedAt": "[ISO 8601 timestamp]",
    "generatedBy": "[model name]"
  },
  "content": {
    "title": "ERROR: Unable to fetch content",
    "url": "[provided URL]",
    "language": "en",
    "contentType": "📊 Industry News (業界ニュース)",
    "oneSentenceSummary": "Content fetch failed.",
    "summaryBody": "No content available to summarize.",
    "topics": ["Error"],
    "scores": {
      "signal": 0,
      "depth": 0,
      "uniqueness": 0,
      "practical": 0,
      "antiHype": 0,
      "mainJournal": 0,
      "annexPotential": 0,

# **Instructions**

Adhere to the editorial persona defined at the end of this prompt.

Your task is to summarize a given article for a weekly journal on Generative AI in coding. The summary must be in Japanese.

The audience consists of web application engineers. Your summary should focus on "what happened" and, more importantly, "why it matters" from their perspective. Use a direct, active voice and strong verbs.

First classify the article using the content type framework and then score it using the scoring framework defined at the end of this prompt.

The final output must be valid JSON matching this structure:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "version": "1.0",
    "generatedAt": "[ISO 8601 timestamp]",
    "generatedBy": "[model identifier]"
  },
  "content": {
    "title": "[Article title in Japanese]",
    "originalTitle": "[Original title in source language - only if non-Japanese, otherwise null]",
    "url": "[Exact original URL - DO NOT modify]",
    "language": "[ja/en/other]",
    "contentType": "[One of 8 types from content type framework]",
    "oneSentenceSummary": "[One sentence in Japanese]",
    "summaryBody": "[Full summary in markdown format]",
    "topics": ["[topic1]", "[topic2]", "[topic3]"],
    "scores": {
      "signal": 0-5,
      "depth": 0-5,
      "uniqueness": 0-5,
      "practical": 0-5,
      "antiHype": 0-5,
      "mainJournal": 0-100,
