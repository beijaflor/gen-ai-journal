# **Goal**

Summarize the article according to instructions below. Output the summary as structured JSON matching the v1.0 schema.

**⚠️ CRITICAL — URL RULE (read first):**
The `content.url` field in your JSON output MUST be the **exact string** passed to `{{fetch:"{{url}}"}}` at the end of this prompt — character-for-character, no changes. Do **NOT** resolve redirects, shorten, canonicalize, guess, or "correct" the URL in any way. Copy it verbatim.

**IMPORTANT**: Before generating JSON, detect the article language:
- If language is **Japanese** (ja): **DO NOT** include the `originalTitle` field in your JSON output
- If language is **English/other** (en/other): **MUST** include the `originalTitle` field with the original title

Article contents is very last of prompt.

**IMPORTANT**: Your output MUST use this exact nested structure:

**For Japanese articles (DO NOT include originalTitle field):**
```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "version": "1.0",
    "generatedAt": "2026-02-08T14:00:00Z",
    "generatedBy": "gemini-3-flash-preview"
  },
  "content": {
    "title": "日本語の記事タイトルをそのまま使用",
    "url": "https://...",
    "language": "ja",
    "contentType": "🔬 Research & Analysis (研究・分析)",
    "oneSentenceSummary": "One sentence in Japanese",
    "summaryBody": "Full summary body in markdown format",
    "topics": ["topic1", "topic2", "topic3"],
    "scores": {
      "signal": 4,
      "depth": 3,
      "uniqueness": 4,
      "practical": 4,
      "antiHype": 5,
      "mainJournal": 75,
      "annexPotential": 80,
      "overall": 78
    }
  }
}
```

**For English/other language articles (INCLUDE originalTitle field):**
```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "version": "1.0",
    "generatedAt": "2026-02-08T14:00:00Z",
    "generatedBy": "gemini-3-flash-preview"
  },
  "content": {
    "title": "日本語に翻訳されたタイトル",
    "originalTitle": "Original English Title from the Page",
    "url": "https://...",
    "language": "en",
    "contentType": "🔬 Research & Analysis (研究・分析)",
    "oneSentenceSummary": "One sentence in Japanese",
    "summaryBody": "Full summary body in markdown format",
    "topics": ["topic1", "topic2", "topic3"],
    "scores": {
      "signal": 4,
      "depth": 3,
      "uniqueness": 4,
      "practical": 4,

      "mainJournal": 75,
      "annexPotential": 80,
      "overall": 78
    }
  }
}
```

**You must output ONLY this JSON structure. Do not add any other fields at the root level.**

# **Content Validation**

Before summarizing, check if article content was successfully fetched:
- If content is empty, missing, or fetch failed → Return JSON with error indicator:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "version": "1.0",
    "generatedAt": "[ISO 8601 timestamp]",
    "generatedBy": "[model name]"
  },
  "content": {
    "title": "ERROR: Unable to fetch content",
    "url": "[provided URL]",
    "language": "en",
    "contentType": "📊 Industry News (業界ニュース)",
    "oneSentenceSummary": "Content fetch failed.",
    "summaryBody": "No content available to summarize.",
    "topics": ["Error"],
    "scores": {
      "signal": 0,
      "depth": 0,
      "uniqueness": 0,
      "practical": 0,
      "antiHype": 0,
      "mainJournal": 0,
      "annexPotential": 0,
      "overall": 0
    }
  }
}
```

# **Instructions**

Adhere to the editorial persona defined at the end of this prompt.

Your task is to summarize a given article for a weekly journal on Generative AI in coding. The summary must be in Japanese.

The audience consists of web application engineers. Your summary should focus on "what happened" and, more importantly, "why it matters" from their perspective. Use a direct, active voice and strong verbs.

First classify the article using the content type framework and then score it using the scoring framework defined at the end of this prompt.

The final output must be valid JSON matching this structure:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "version": "1.0",
    "generatedAt": "[ISO 8601 timestamp]",
    "generatedBy": "[model identifier]"
  },
  "content": {
    "title": "[Article title in Japanese]",
    "originalTitle": "[Original title in source language - ONLY for non-Japanese articles, omit for Japanese]",
    "url": "[Exact original URL - DO NOT modify]",
    "language": "[ja/en/other]",
    "contentType": "[One of 8 types from content type framework]",
    "oneSentenceSummary": "[One sentence in Japanese]",
    "summaryBody": "[Full summary in markdown format]",
    "topics": ["[topic1]", "[topic2]", "[topic3]"],
    "scores": {
      "signal": 0-5,
      "depth": 0-5,
      "uniqueness": 0-5,
      "practical": 0-5,
      "antiHype": 0-5,
      "mainJournal": 0-100,
      "annexPotential": 0-100,
      "overall": 0-100
    }
  }
}
```

**Instructions for each field:**

## metadata object

- **version**: Always "1.0" (string literal)
- **generatedAt**: Current timestamp in ISO 8601 format (e.g., "2026-02-08T14:30:00Z")
- **generatedBy**: Model identifier (e.g., "gemini-3-flash-preview")

## content object

**CRITICAL**: The `originalTitle` field behavior depends on article language:
- **Japanese articles**: Omit the `originalTitle` field entirely (do not include it in the JSON)
- **Non-Japanese articles**: Include the `originalTitle` field with the original title

1.  **title** (string, required):
    - If article language is **Japanese**: Use original Japanese title as-is
    - If article language is **English**: Translate title to Japanese
    - If article language is **other**: Translate title to Japanese
    - Length: 1-200 characters

2.  **originalTitle** (string, optional):
    - **ONLY include this field for non-Japanese articles**
    - If article language is **Japanese**: **DO NOT include this field in the JSON output** (omit entirely, do not set to null)
    - If article language is **English**: Include with original English title from the page
    - If article language is **other**: Include with original title in source language
    - Length: 1-300 characters
    - **Title selection rule**:
      - For non-Japanese pages: Use translated Japanese title for `title` field, preserve original in `originalTitle`
      - For Japanese pages: Use page title as-is for `title` field (no translation/modification)

3.  **url** (string, required):
    - **MUST be the exact URL string from the `{{fetch:"..."}}` call at the bottom of this prompt — copied character-for-character**
    - Do NOT resolve redirects, canonicalize, guess, shorten, or alter the URL in any way
    - The URL you received in the fetch instruction is the authoritative value; use it as-is
    - Must be valid URI format

4.  **language** (string, required):
    - Detect primary language of source article
    - Must be one of: "ja", "en", "other"

5.  **contentType** (string, required):
    - Classify using content type framework below
    - Must be one of 8 defined types (see framework)
    - Include both emoji and bilingual label (e.g., "🔬 Research & Analysis (研究・分析)")

6.  **oneSentenceSummary** (string, required):
    - Single descriptive sentence in Japanese
    - Neutrally conveys author's main point
    - Start with strong, active verb
    - Length: 10-300 characters

7.  **summaryBody** (string, required):

    - **Standard articles**: 450-650 characters (DEFAULT)
    - **Deep technical/multi-faceted**: 650-800 characters

    **Summary Body Structure:**
    1. **What's covered** (2-3 sentences): Core topic and scope with concrete details
    2. **Key insights/takeaways** (2-4 sentences): Main points, specific tools/techniques, practical learnings
    3. **Who should read** (1 sentence): Clear target audience and decision trigger

    **Writing Guidelines:**
    - Use **bold** for specific tool names and technical terms
    - Be concrete about techniques and methodologies
    - Focus on decision-making value
    - Avoid generic padding or excessive interpretation
    - For technical articles, be specific about the techniques described

8.  **topics** (array of strings, required):
    - Provide 1-5 key topics
    - Relevant to AI coding, development tools, or workflows
