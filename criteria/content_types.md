# Content Type Classification Guide

## Purpose

This document defines 9 objective content types for systematic article classification during curation. Each type receives specific editorial treatment to optimize reader experience and journal composition.

## Classification Principles

- **Objective**: Based on content structure and format, not subjective value judgments
- **Mutually Exclusive**: Each article belongs to exactly one type
- **Treatment-Oriented**: Each type implies specific summary approach and editorial voice

## Decision Framework

### For Ambiguous Cases

1. **Primary Content Focus**: What is the main subject matter?
2. **Author Intent**: What is the primary purpose of the article?
3. **Content Structure**: How is the information presented?
4. **Source Type**: Who published it and in what context?

### Common Edge Cases

- **Tool Tutorial vs. Tutorial**: If focused on specific tool ‚Üí ‚öôÔ∏è Tools; if teaching general concepts ‚Üí üìñ Tutorial
- **Opinion with Data vs. Research**: If personal interpretation dominates ‚Üí üí≠ Opinion; if methodology dominates ‚Üí üî¨ Research
- **News vs. Analysis**: If announcing facts ‚Üí üì∞ News; if interpreting implications ‚Üí üî¨ Research

### Classification Priority

1. **Specialized Types** (AI Hype, AI Etiquette, Tools) take precedence when applicable
2. **Content Structure** over author intent
3. **Primary Focus** over secondary elements

## Integration with Curation Workflow

### In STEP_04_CURATE_MAIN.md

1. **Review Summary**: Read the article summary
2. **Apply Framework**: Use decision criteria above
3. **Assign Type**: Select single most appropriate type
