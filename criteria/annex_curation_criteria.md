# Annex Journal Curation Criteria (v4: Edgy & Insightful)

The Annex Journal is a curated collection for readers seeking unique, non-obvious insights that challenge their thinking. It is the "B-side" of deep cuts, not a repository for leftovers.

## Core Principles

1.  **Strict Exclusivity:** The Annex is curated *exclusively* from `omitted_sources.md`. Any article chosen for the main journal is automatically ineligible for the Annex, ensuring zero overlap.
2.  **Demand for Originality:** Every selected source must provide a unique perspective, novel knowledge, or a fresh point of view. If a reader can find the same idea everywhere else, it doesn't belong here.
3.  **Zero Hype Policy:** We filter aggressively for substance over speculation. Articles must be grounded in practical reality, deep analysis, or credible, evidence-backed arguments. Marketing fluff and hype are explicitly rejected.

## Content Pillars

1.  **Advanced Tactics & Unconventional Wisdom:**
    - **What it is:** Actionable guides, clever tool configurations, and non-obvious techniques that offer a high-leverage advantage. We skip "Hello World" and focus on the "Aha!" moments for experienced practitioners.
    - **Why it's in the Annex:** It provides the "how" in a way that respects the reader's intelligence, focusing on practical, edgy solutions that aren't part of the mainstream narrative.

2.  **Substantive Critique & Contrarian Views:**
    - **What it is:** Well-reasoned critiques of current trends, contrarian viewpoints that challenge the consensus, and deep dives into the potential second-order effects of new technologies.
    - **Why it's in the Annex:** These are the important, often-unheard arguments that provide a more complete picture of the AI landscape. It's the home for the loyal opposition and the critical friend.

3.  **Niche Explorations & Deep Dives:**
    - **What it is:** In-depth explorations of niche topics, specialized use cases, or forgotten histories that shed new light on the present.
    - **Why it's in the Annex:** To surface valuable knowledge from the long tail, giving readers access to ideas they wouldn't encounter in mainstream sources.
